# Psychrometric analysis of HVAC systems

Three Jupyter Notebooks for analysing HVAC systems in winter:
1. Winter loads `winter_Loads.ipynb`
2. Heating and vapor humidification `winter_VaHum_wd.ipynb`
3. Heating and adiabatic humidification `winter_AdHum_wd.ipynb`

To experiment with the Notebook:

1. Select a notebook

2. Kernel / Restart & Run All

3. Play with the widgets
