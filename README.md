# Psychrometric analysis of HVAC systems

Three Jupyter Notebooks for analysing HVAC systems:
1. Winter loads `winter_Loads.ipynb`.
2. Heating and vapor humidification `winter_VaHum_wd.ipynb`.
3. Heating and adiabatic humidification `winter_AdHum_wd.ipynb`.
4. Cooling and reheating `summer_CoolReH.ipynb`.

To experiment with the notebooks:
> Select a notebook

> Kernel / Restart & Run All

> Play with the widgets
